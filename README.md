This day planner was dynamically created in JavaScript using jQuery and Moment.js <br>
<br>
The current time is compared to an array of work hours to determine the timeblock's class. The past is highlighted in grey, red represents the current hour and green signifies the future.
<br>
<br>
Tasks are saved to local storge using the icon button. They can also be updated or cleared by simply saving a new or empty task within that block.
